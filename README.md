# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the daily puzzles from the annual Advent of Code events.

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge that takes place in December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, and participants are invited to solve it using their programming skills. It's a fun and engaging way to improve your coding abilities and problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by year, with a separate folder for each year's puzzles. Within each year, the structure is further organized as follows:

- **2023**: Contains solutions for the puzzles released in 2023.
  - **Day 1**
    - `input.txt`: Puzzle input for both parts.
    - `puzzle1.py`: Python script for solving the first part.
    - `puzzle2.py`: Python script for solving the second part.
  - **Day 2**
    - `input.txt`: Puzzle input for both parts.
    - `puzzle1.py`: Python script for solving the first part.
    - `puzzle2.py`: Python script for solving the second part.
  - ... (repeat for each day)

Feel free to explore the individual day folders to find the solutions and input files for each day's challenges.

## Getting Started
If you're new to Advent of Code or want to participate yourself, you can visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/) to access the daily puzzles. Remember not to peek at the solutions before attempting to solve the puzzles on your own!

## Running the Code
The solutions are implemented in Python, and you can run them by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Navigate to the specific day folder (e.g., `2023/Day 1`) to find the solutions for that day.
3. Run the Python scripts by executing the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

For Puzzle 1:
   ```bash
   python puzzle1.py
   ```
For Puzzle 2:

   ```bash
   python puzzle2.py
   ```
Make sure you have the necessary input files or input data as required by the specific puzzle.

## Contributing
If you have alternative solutions, improvements, or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always open to collaboration and learning from others!

## Disclaimer
These solutions are my personal implementations for the Advent of Code puzzles. While they may not be the most optimized or elegant solutions, they represent my thought process and approach to solving the challenges.

Happy coding, and may your Advent of Code journey be filled with joy and successful problem-solving!
